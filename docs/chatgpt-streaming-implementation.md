# ChatGPT Streaming Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds real-time streaming responses to the ChatGPT integration, allowing users to see AI responses as they are being generated rather than waiting for the complete response.

## Backend Changes

### PropertySearchController.php
- Modified `propertyAskAi()` method to support streaming
- Added `streamChatGptResponse()` private method for handling streaming
- Added fallback to non-streaming response if streaming fails

### Key Features
- **Streaming Support**: Uses cURL with streaming to OpenAI API
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback to non-streaming if streaming fails
- **Proper Headers**: Sets appropriate headers for streaming responses
- **Nginx Compatibility**: Includes `X-Accel-Buffering: no` header

## Frontend Changes

### PropertyAskAiDialog.vue
- Replaced axios with fetch API for streaming support
- Added real-time message updates as content streams in
- Implemented proper error handling with fallback
- Added visual feedback during generation

### Key Features
- **Real-time Updates**: Messages appear character by character as they're generated
- **Fallback Mechanism**: Automatically falls back to non-streaming if streaming fails
- **Error Recovery**: Removes empty messages and retries with non-streaming
- **Visual Feedback**: Shows "Generating..." indicator during streaming

## How It Works

1. **User sends message**: Frontend adds user message to chat
2. **Streaming request**: Frontend makes fetch request with `stream: true`
3. **Backend streaming**: Controller uses cURL to stream from OpenAI
4. **Real-time updates**: Frontend reads stream and updates message content
5. **Fallback**: If streaming fails, automatically tries non-streaming request

## Configuration

### Required Environment Variables
```env
CHAT_GPT_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

### Server Requirements
- PHP with cURL extension enabled
- Proper server configuration for streaming (nginx/apache)
- Sufficient timeout settings

## Testing

To test the streaming implementation:

1. Open the property AI dialog
2. Send a message
3. Observe the response appearing character by character
4. Check browser network tab for streaming response

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **No streaming**: Check if cURL is enabled in PHP
- **Timeout errors**: Increase timeout settings in controller
- **Nginx buffering**: Ensure `X-Accel-Buffering: no` header is set
- **CORS issues**: Verify proper headers are set

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging in the controller to see detailed error information.
